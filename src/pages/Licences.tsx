                              # Attribution
                              Attribution is required by MIT, SIL OFL, and CC BY licenses. Downloaded Font
                              Awesome Free files already contain embedded comments with sufficient
                              attribution, so you shouldn't need to do anything additional when using these
                              files normally.<br /><br />

                              We've kept attribution comments terse, so we ask that you do not actively work
                              to remove them from files, especially code. They're a great way for folks to
                              learn about Font Awesome.<br /><br />
